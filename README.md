  The main application. It includes:
  - Tailwind CSS for styling  
  - FontAwesome for icons  
  - JSZip for batch ZIP downloads  
  - Google AdSense placeholders  
  - Structured data for SEO  
  - JavaScript logic (embedded in the HTML) for compression, batch handling, and UI control

  The file you're currently reading. Includes project overview, features, usage, and contribution guidelines.
